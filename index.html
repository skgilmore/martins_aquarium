        <div class="location__description">Home to over 1500 different species of tropical fish and other variants, the Great Barrier Reef is teeming with life. The reef is home to fish of both of ends of the spectrum- from small bait fish through to the largest varieties of sharks on earth. The sheer volume and density of fish varieties which can be found within a small area make the reef a diver and snorkelerâ€˜s paradise. It is not uncommon to encounter hundreds of different species of fish within a single area of the ocean. Despite the staggering quantities of fishes that dwell within its waters, the fish of the Great Barrier Reef are divided up in to surprisingly few main families, each with significantly differing characteristics that mark the difference from one family to the next.</div>
